Second day we have already about time so the first most important thing to look for is if conflict now why is that you see seven security of every device is connected with there are highest Internet service providers who are they geo Airtel texas I don't know so these are the IST deployers network and from their network all of the devices are connected and all of the devices are assigned ipd networks Internet protocol six six and each device carries its own unique mac address and that is very crucial to you know identify an individual device because ip is dynamic the change you know just just open your phone go to chrome and search for their whatsapp if you are going to show you at specific ip turn your aeroplane mode on turn off your aeroplane and then once again cheque your application because it is dynamic well it's no use in gonna be alloted to somewhere else so relying on ip is not something we prefer but your ip is really essential because you know we have friends your package which transferred to ips but right now we are learning about the main packet like the basics of milk and stuff so imagine you are at home and there is a router and the router is connected it is your router and it is connected with the isp medicine sprotter the router carries loss of ip access with himself with itself now the router provides Internet the whole home the whole house now lots of devices are connected to that cell phones ac smart devices like Alexa or Google something I do not know now what is going to happen they will call a share how are they connected they are connected with wifi 5 gigahertz wifi or five gigahertz 552.4 I guess yeah are pretty bad so yeah what is happening is that the router is connected router has a gear and a ck acknowledge packet all these devices there and they all devices receive the packet and receive the acknowledgement and they all send and acknowledgement for acceptance to be connectivity and then the router said all right all right I also accept this at the connexion is built it is a 4 way handshake method it is like for the tcp is a 3rd way headship method and that is all the devices are connected with routers you know using Wifi now each device has the router assigned to each device and it is a specific need ip address ok and by default each device has its own mac address and because router connects all the devices router carries the data of all the devices all the devices ip addresses all the devices so if you can access the router we can easily identify each individual device with its flag at and work and this is apartheid for a hackle to enter into a system now there are few common syntax we have learned so far the first is if config in order to cheque the ip address you know the ip address and Mac address to use the perfect links and then there was pseudo pseudo command is to you know go for the root user and then there was L S cheque whatever like wherever we have open the terminal of that directly what are the all the files that is that is Alice and right now that's all I have done see you soon
